## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and local storage
- **Font Awesome** – Icons


## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types a task into the input field.
2. Clicking the "+" button adds the task to the list and saves it to localStorage.
3. Each task has:
   - A checkbox to mark it complete/incomplete.
   - An edit icon to update the task.
   - A delete icon to remove it.
4. A progress bar visually shows how many tasks are completed out of total tasks.


## 📦 Setup Instructions

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Start adding your tasks!

## 🔒 Local Storage Usage

The app uses the browser's `localStorage` to store task data. Tasks will remain available even after refreshing or closing the browser tab.
